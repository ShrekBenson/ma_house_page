A restaurant page (Ma's House) for my practice about Webpack.
Since 1948, when a kind and humble grandmother started sharing her food around the neighborhood, an idea was born. To bring the homemade flavor to the whole country, in order to offer a warm and welcoming experience to anyone who wanted to enjoy it. Since then, this house has worked hard to keep this dream in the palate of each person, offering one of the warmest and most exquisite experiences.
